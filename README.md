# Planning and Designing a Cloud-Environment

## Objective

We figure out how you will estimate cloud virtual machine operations expenses for an organization. We will be using
online price calculators from Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud Platform. This is a key business requirement as
well as it contributes to capacity planning.

### Stage 1: Azure Virtual Machine Pricing Calculator

We will first work with Microsoft Azure's cloud services. The pricing calculator is below.
