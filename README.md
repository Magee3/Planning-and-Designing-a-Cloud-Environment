# Planning and Designing a Cloud-Environment

## Objective

We figure out how you will estimate cloud virtual machine operations expenses for an organization. We will be using
online price calculators from Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud Platform. This is a key business requirement as
well as it contributes to capacity planning.

### Stage 1: Azure Virtual Machine Pricing Calculator

We will first work with Microsoft Azure's cloud services. The pricing calculator is below.

Next select virtual machines, this is what we will be using for our cloud service.

If you scroll down you can see the default package is $137.24 well at the time that I post this write up.

In Azure there are two operating systems you can use and that is Windows or Linux.

With that there are various types of the operating system you can choose from.
